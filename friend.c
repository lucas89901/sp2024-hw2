    1. read from parent/stdin
    2. determine what the command is (Meet, Check, Adopt, Graduate, Compare(bonus)), I recommend using strcmp() and/or char check
    3. find out who should execute the command (extract information received)
    4. execute the command or tell the requested friend to execute the command
        4.1 command passing may be required here
    5. after previous command is done, repeat step 1.

        check if you are parent or child
        as parent or child, think about what you do next.

        distribute the info into levels 1 to 7 (refer to Additional Specifications: subtree level <= 7)
        use above distribution to print out level by level
            Q: why do above? can you make each process print itself?

        obtain the info of child node subtree, what are their info?
            Q: look at the info you got, how do you know where they are in the subtree?
            Hint: Think about how to recreate the subtree to design your info format
        A. terminate the entire child node subtree
        B. send the info through FIFO to parent node
            Q: why FIFO? will usin pipe here work? why of why not?
            Hint: Think about time efficiency, and message length
        C. parent node recreate the child node subtree with the obtained info
            Q: which of A, B and C should be done first? does parent child position in the tree matter?
            Hint: when does blocking occur when using FIFO?(mkfifo, open, read, write, unlink)
        please remember to mod the values of the subtree, you may use bruteforce methods to do this part (I did)
        also remember to print the output
