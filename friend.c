/*
If you need help from TAs,
please remember :
0. Show your efforts
    0.1 Fully understand course materials
    0.2 Read the spec thoroughly, including frequently updated FAQ section
    0.3 Use online resources
    0.4 Ask your friends while avoiding plagiarism, they might be able to understand you better, since the TAs know the solution, 
        they might not understand what you're trying to do as quickly as someone who is also doing this homework.
1. be respectful
2. the quality of your question will directly impact the value of the response you get.
3. think about what you want from your question, what is the response you expect to get
4. what do you want the TA to help you with. 
    4.0 Unrelated to Homework (wsl, workstation, systems configuration)
    4.1 Debug
    4.2 Logic evaluation (we may answer doable yes or no, but not always correct or incorrect, as it might be giving out the solution)
    4.3 Spec details inquiry
    4.4 Testcase possibility
5. If the solution to answering your question requires the TA to look at your code, you probably shouldn't ask it.
6. We CANNOT tell you the answer, but we can tell you how your current effort may approach it.
7. If you come with nothing, we cannot help you with anything.

    1. read from parent/stdin
    2. determine what the command is (Meet, Check, Adopt, Graduate, Compare(bonus)), I recommend using strcmp() and/or char check
    3. find out who should execute the command (extract information received)
    4. execute the command or tell the requested friend to execute the command
        4.1 command passing may be required here
    5. after previous command is done, repeat step 1.

            Hint: Think about how to recreate the subtree to design your info format
        A. terminate the entire child node subtree
        B. send the info through FIFO to parent node
            Q: why FIFO? will usin pipe here work? why of why not?

        C. parent node recreate the child node subtree with the obtained info
            Q: which of A, B and C should be done first? does parent child position in the tree matter?
            Hint: when does blocking occur when using FIFO?(mkfifo, open, read, write, unlink)
